# mann
With mann you will never forget command line options again.

## What is a mann page?
A mann page is a man page that you author.

Whenever you learn a new command, add a note for it to its mann page.
Then, at any time if you need to recall that command, just view its mann page.

## Install

```
npm install -g mann
```

## Usage

View a command's mann page:

```
mann <command>
```

Edit a command's man page:

```
mann -e <command>
```

You can mark section headers by a sharp sign (just as you do in Markdown), and mann will display them in green for better readability.
